When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with other users. For using the files somewhere not local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can get the latest changes when you need them. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a GitHub terms to clone a repository to your own GitHub account. Clones are a Git term to clone a repository to your local 
working directory. Branches are where you take existing code and break off to another spot to develop new features or something else and
not affect the original code. You use branches when you want to experiment with the intention of putting it back into the code. You use
Fork when you want to create your own project from another project on GitHub. You use clone when you want to copy an existing project to
your local working directory.
